Today we will exchange feedback.

11:00 - everyone gets 15 minutes to prepare a brief presentation
11:15 - 11:40 - first round of presentations
11:40 - 12:05 - second round of presentations
12:05 - 12:15 - whole-class discussion on any common themes we noticed

When presenting, should cover:
  - What is the specific initial goal? Equations to solve, type of network being used, BCs, ICs, etc.
  - What is the status of the code implementation? Does the code run? How long does it take to run? Any questions about implementation or code?
  - What is the status of results? Is the method working? What specific issues are stopping progress?
  - What are the next steps?

When providing feedback:
  - Use the same list as above.
  - Make sure you (as a listener) understand what is happening.
  - Donâ€™t just trust the presenting person!
  - Ask questions until you understand the problem, the code, and the state of the results.

Make notes in a markdown file (netids) on feedback you *receive*.
